print()     #prints whatever is in the parantheses to the console.  i.e,, print("Hello World!")

#   A comment. This is so you can read your program later. Anything after the # is ignored by python.

+, -, *, / #Regular math operators

< #less than

<= #"Less than or equal to"
>=#"Greater than or equal to"
% # shows the "modulo" or remainder of a division

= # variable assignment statement. i,e,, car = subaru or answer = 4 + 20 

== # checks whether both sides of the == have the same value 

f"" # This tells python to "Format" this string, this lets you insert variables into strings.
{} #This tells python where to put a variable in a formatted string. f"{}" 
.format() #Another way to format a string

"\n" #Creates a new line in a string
"\t" #Tabs a string in 

input() #Takes input from a user. This can be strings, numbers, etc. i.e, name = input("Name?")

import #Allows you to borrow code from the standard python library or other modules without writing it
        # out yourself.

argv #"Argument variable." This statement hold the arguments you pass to your python script from the CLI.
module #Collections of functions from other peoples Python code that you can import
open() #Takes a parameter (filename) and returns it so you can assign it to a variable, etc 
close() #Closes specified file
read() #Reads the contents of a file that can then be assigned to a variable 
readline() #reads one specific line 
truncate # Empties the file. Use with caution 
write('Stuff') # writes 'Stuff' to the file
seek(0) #Move the read/write location to the beginning of the file. Similar to DVD, VHS, etc. 
function #A function lets you name a section of code the way variables name strings or numbers. They take arguments the way scripts use ARGV. This lets you automate repetitive tasks in your code or 
        # import it to other programs, etc. 

def #Used to 'define' a new function

return #Lets a python function "Return" the answer to the function to the rest of the program
